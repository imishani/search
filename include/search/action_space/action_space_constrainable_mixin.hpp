The pure virtual isConstrainedStateValid method is added, and must be implemented by the user if they want to use constraint-based search algorithms. In these algorithms, this method wil replace the familiar isStateValid method of Action Spaces. This new method is used to check if a given state is valid with respect to the constraints.
